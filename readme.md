# Music.php

**The project is now in beta! Clone the repository from here, or use the Docker image (coming soon)..
As always, beware of bugs!**

## What is Music.php?
Music.php is a Laravel project created as a self hosted alternative to other music streaming services such as Spotify.

While services such as Spotify work fine for most other people, I had numerous pet peeves about it:

- Lack of various selections in the Spotify library
- Advertisements
- The costs of Spotify Premium
- Advanced library management capabilities

As a result, I set out to develop Music.php with all of these ideas in mind.
