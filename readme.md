# Music.php

## What is Music.php?
Music.php is a Laravel project created as a self hosted alternative to other music streaming services such as Spotify.
While services such as Spotify work fine for most other people, I had numerous pet peeves about it:

- Lack of certain selections in the Spotify library (did someone say Eurovision?)
- Advertisements
- And of course, the costs of Spotify Premium

As a result, this project was created to allow for a self managed experience with music streaming.
